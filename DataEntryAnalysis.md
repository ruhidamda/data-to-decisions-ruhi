# Data Entry Analysis

### 1: Some of the problems in the way that the data are currently organized 
* Metadata: The datasets do not contain any information about the variables that are measured including units of measurement
* Missing data fields: The tables have a few missing fields. This is an inconsistency.
* Highlighted fields: Some fields are highlighted with no explanation about the significance
* Inconsistent data: The variables measured accross the datasets are not consistent
* Incomplete data: One of the phenomenon of interest is the day-night distribution of plankton. It would be valuable to record the time of day at which the data was recorded.
* Data labels: The graph does not have labels for the variables on each of the axes.

### 2: Suggested system for organization

| Date  (mm-dd-yyyy) | Time  (24h time clock) | Depth  (m) | Temperature  (C) | Chlorophyll concentration (mg/L) | Chippo  (#/L) | Chippo colony diameter  (mm) | Cuni  (#/L) | Cuni colony diameter  (mm) |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
|                    |                        |            |                  |                                  |               |                              |             |                            |
|                    |                        |            |                  |                                  |               |                              |             |                            |
